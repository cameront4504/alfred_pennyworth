# TO DO LIST
"""

        - Streamline Thoughts
            + Maybe certain functions, like change name / change assist name could be combined?
            + Instead, dialogue and variables would change depending on what or who is being changed
            + Similarly, have all changes to settings.txt run through updateSettings
                - Use parameters to change what sections are affected
        - Things to Streamline:
            + JSON reading and writing? [x]
            +
            +
        - Remembrance:
            + Has user already interacted with assistant. If so, change some lines like
            + "What nickname would you like?" would be "What would you like to change your nickname to?"
